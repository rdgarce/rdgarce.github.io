        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Raffaele del Gaudio and I am a Computer Engineer.
            For as long as I can remember, I have been passionate about everything related to computers,
            but I have also been a judoka for 15 years and I love good food.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in system software, networking, operating systems, but also in hardware and
            more theoretical concepts. We could talk for hours about cache coherence protocol and I will not be bored ðŸ˜„.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here I write articles about topics I find relevant and interesting on software and hardware.
            All the articles have to be considered unfinished in the sense that I am willing to collect your
            feedbacks to update them. By the way, you can connect with me on
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdgarce/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or at raffio98 [at] gmail.com.
